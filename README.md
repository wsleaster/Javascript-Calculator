# Javascript-Calculator
A project I created for free code camp using HTML, CSS and Javascript

I created this project for Free Code Camp using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is a simple calculator that takes the value of a button and inputs it into the input field with ID screen. It then uses a function to do the math in the input field. The user can manually type into the input field or use the buttons and hit enter.
